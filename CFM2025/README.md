Here are the files relative to the simulation performed in the conference paper, which deals on
metallurgical phase transformation.

## Description

 - TaylorPhaseTransform.mfront : the homogenized/macroscopic behaviour law using Taylor scheme
 - SachsPhaseTransform.mfront : the same for Sachs scheme
 - plastic.mfront : the local behaviour of martensite
 - viscoplastic.mfront : the local behaviour of austenite
 - taylor.dgibi : the Cast3m file for the simulation on the cylinder
 - sachs.dgibi : the same file with a little modifications for using the Sachs behaviour law
